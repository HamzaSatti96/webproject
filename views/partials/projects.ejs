                <span>I recently started my courses for this fall semester, including one of the most exciting and interesting course to learn which is Web and Script Programming. As part of it, I am creating a Portfolio about myself that also include some projects Iâ€™ve worked in. Some of these projects are:</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span>Developed a Sudoku and boggle solver using vision systems and machine learning with OpenCV and TensorFlow (140 hours)</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Gained an understanding of data structures, various sorting algorithms, multi-threading/processing, low level memory manipulation, and machine learning algorithms in several Computer Science classes.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Learned how to code in Batch and Powershell during slow phone traffic at a Local Corporation which led to a new position in Automation Scripting, allowing the company to save hundreds of man-hours.</span>
